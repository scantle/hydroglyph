[Here](https://github.com/MarcDiethelm/contributing/blob/master/README.md "Contributing") is a great primer on contributing to GitHub projects.

## Adding to Hydroglyph
You'll need the code (either downloaded from here, or cloned from your own fork) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm "Get NPM")
1. Open a command prompt/console and navigate to the Hydroglyph directory. Type `npm install` and press enter. NPM will install the required packages.
2. If you don't intend to edit the project in an IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code), you can at this point type `npm start` and press enter. Node will launch a local server for you, allowing you to view Hydroglyph in your browser. Changes made to the code will be shown instantaneously.
3. Alternatively, open the Hydroglyph folder as a project in an IDE like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/ "VS Code"). Similarly, you can use the inline terminal to launch a local server, but the IDE will also allow for easy breakpoint debugging.
